To deploy this very simple application, I created a fly.io account, then opened the directory containing the Dockerfile for this exercise, and ran `fly launch`. I was then prompted if I want to change the default configuration, and I just changed the name of the app to "basic-flask-app-exercise-16". After a little bit of waiting, my app was deployed. It is accessible at [basic-flask-app-exercise-16.fly.dev/](https://basic-flask-app-exercise-16.fly.dev/)
